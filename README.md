# Reprogramming_Osteosarcoma

This repository contains the analysis for reprogramming OS states to those associated with chemotherapeutic sensitivity.
  
  
Section 1: Identifying states A, B and C within the OS PDX-derived cell lines. The plain_scRNAseq_analysis folder contains the scripts for this analysis.

- The plain_scRNAseq_analysis.ipynb script contains the code for State definition using the NMF method.

Section 2: Identifying the sensitive state using a lineage tracing approach. 

Section 3: Identifying candidate drivers for the different states

- CellRank scripts

Section 4: Identifying transcription factor drivers capable of reprogramming cells to the sensitive state. Analysis for this section are in Perturb_seq_analysis.
