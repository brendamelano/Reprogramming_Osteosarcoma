# Reprogramming_Osteosarcoma

This repository contains the analysis for reprogramming OS states to those that are associated with chemotherapeutic sensitivity


Section 1: Identifying states A, B and C within the OS PDX-derived cell lines. The plain_scRNAseq_analysis folder contains the analysis for this task.

Section 2: Identifying the sensitive state using a lineage tracing approach. The lineage tracing folder contains the analysis for this task.

Section 3: Identifying candidate drivers for the different states

  CiberATAC
    scripts for generating RDS files are in the plain_scRNAseq_analysis directories because those datasets were used as the CiberATAC input

Section 4: Identifying transcription factor drivers capable of reprogramming cells to the sensitive state. Analysis for this section are in Perturb_seq_analysis.
