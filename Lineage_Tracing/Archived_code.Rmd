## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# Zscore analysis used when I only had one replicate

# taking the difference of the log transformed values
# need to add the barcode_mean_ctrl_13 (add the log suffix too)
pf_diff_merged <- OS384_pf_final %>% mutate(difference_pf_log2 = barcode_log_mean_ctrl_13 - barcode_mean_pf_log)


# Scaling the data    
pf_diff_merged <- pf_diff_merged %>% mutate(log2_diff_zscore_pf = scale(difference_pf_log2))


# Merging atr_diff_ordered with ctrl day 0 barcode counts by barcode
pf_diff_merged <- merge(pf_diff_merged, OS384ctrl0_log_scaled, by = "barcode")


# Ordering based on the difference of z scores
pf_diff_ordered <- pf_diff_merged[order(pf_diff_merged$difference_pf_log2, decreasing = T), ]


# Plotting z score v counts at time 0
ggplot(pf_diff_ordered, aes(x = barcode_mean_ctrl_0 , y = log2_diff_zscore_pf )) + 
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10') + 
  geom_line(y=1.96) + 
  geom_line(y = -1.96) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  ylab('Z-score of log2 difference') + 
  xlab('log transformed counts - Day 0') +
  ggtitle('Barcode selection with CDK 4/6 inhibitor')


# filtering the z-scores to keep the top dropouts

z_score_diff_filtered_pf <- pf_diff_ordered %>% filter(log2_diff_zscore_pf > 1)


# Pivoting the the z-score table
z_scores_pivot <- z_score_diff_filtered_pf %>%
  pivot_longer(colnames(z_score_diff_filtered_pf)[2:3]) %>%
  as.data.frame()


# plotting the z-scores for the top barcode dropouts

ggplot(z_scores_pivot, aes(x = name , y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  #scale_y_continuous(trans='log10')  +
  stat_compare_means()

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

# Generating p-values using linear regression
# Fitting the glm model to the data
model <- glm(treated ~ count_scaled_1 + count_scaled_2 + count_scaled_3, 
             data = OS384_logReg_df, 
             family = "binomial"(link = "logit"))


# Making predictions of the same data to extract the p-values
predicted_probabilities <- predict(model, newdata = OS384_logReg_df, type = "response")


# computing the p-values for the volcano plot
p_values <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(predicted_probabilities - 0.5)))


sfit <- summary(model)
coef <- c(t(sfit$coefficients))


# 
summary(p_values)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
